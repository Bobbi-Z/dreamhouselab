Oh boy. Dream House lab. 
I had a rough time starting out THEN I hyper-focused on it for far too long and stayed up way too late and STILL didn’t do everything I wanted to.
Now its past 2AM, I have to sign on at 9 AM, I’m wide awake but my brain is exhausted? 
ADHD sucks ass sometimes.

I left off making sand particles...please don't judge me...
